# Smart Impact IT test

## Installation
Please make sure you have node.js installed in order to use npm.
More details [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

Use npm command:
```bash
npm install
```
## What is done:
1. Username search
2. Load gists details(title,date,filename, language) and show code inside a modal
3. List of forks and users that forked them
4. Optimize search with a delay of 1 second in order to not create api call everytime is typed a letter

## Next steps:
1. Limit number of gists to show. Lets' say 20 and create a "Show more" button to get the next 20 gists and so on to improve UX and performance of page.
The same will be good for files and forks if is possible.
